         * In other words, if a given student row in the database has two related enrollment rows
         * (rows that containt that student's primary key value in their studentid foreign key 
         * column), that student entity's enrollment navigation property will contain those two 
         * enrollment entities.
         * 
         * Navigation properties are typically defined as virtual so that they can take advantage
         * of certain Entity Framework functionality such as as lazy loading.
         * Note:  Lazy Loading is not yet available in EF Core.
